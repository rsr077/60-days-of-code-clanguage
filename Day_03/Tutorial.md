In order to perfrom different kinds of operations,C uses different kinds of operators.
An operator indicates an operation to be performed on data that yields a value.

# b. Conditional operator (?)
The conditional operator contains a condition followed by two statements or values.

# 2. ARITHMETIC OPERATORS 

# a. Binary operator 
The arithmetic operators are used for numerical calculations between teh two constant values.

# b. Increment (++) Decrement(--)

# 3. RELATIONAL OPERATORS 
These operators are used to distinguish between two values depending on their relation.


# 4. LOGICAL OPERATORS 

The logical relationship between the two expressions are chcked with logical operators.After checking the conditions it provides logical true(1)or false(0)status.

# BITWISE OPERATORS 

These operators can operate only on integer operands such as int, char,short long etc.
